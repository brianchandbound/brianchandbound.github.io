## Today's Struggle
I've been working on building up a system for deep learning and heavy computations. 
It's been a month long process of waiting for parts to get cheaper and convincing myself that I'll actually do work with it. 
I've gotten the computer set up, but mostly have been using it as an utterly expensive soundcloud streaming device.

**Specs:**
- Intel 5820K 6-Core process overclocked to 4GHz
- 32 Gb DDR4 Ram overclocked to 3 GHz
- NVidia GTX 980TI with builtin watercooling
- Cool CPU watercooler that changes colors!

**Research Related Accomplishments so far:**
- Installed Ubuntu
- Installed CUDA / CuDNN libraries

**The Struggle Is Real For:**
- Building Tensorflow for GPUs using PiP, but installing into an Anaconda distribution of Python
- This is frustratingly painful
